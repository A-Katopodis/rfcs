# Config File Improvements: Plugin Renaming

## Summary

This proposal adds the feature that renames plugins in config files. This enhancement will be the official successor of `--rulesdir` option. Also, this enhancement is required to [save people from the "plugin conflict" error](major-02-plugin-resolution-change.md#save-people-from-the-plugin-conflict-error).

## Motivation

People cannot define local rules with config files (rather than `--rules` CLI option). The ecosystem has hacked this problem by several plugins to solve such as `eslint-plugin-rulesdir`, `eslint-plugin-local`, etc. However, the official way is great.

Also, to solve "plugin conflict" error, a utility that renames the plugins in shareable configs would be useful. This enhancement is required to implement such a utility.

## Detailed Design

> Proof of Concept (implementation): https://github.com/eslint/eslint/tree/proof-of-concept/config-array-in-eslintrc

This proposal enhances [there](README.md#plugin-renaming).

If `plugins` property of a configuration was an object, `ConfigArrayFactory` loads the value of each property as a plugin then store the loaded plugin as the key of the property. Here, `["foo", "bar"]` is equivalent to `{ "foo": "foo", "bar": "bar" }`. The object form supports file paths.

## Documentation

This enhancement should be documented in "Configuring ESLint" page.

## Drawbacks

I think no problem.

## Backwards Compatibility Analysis

If people depend on the behavior that ESLint throws an error if they give an object to `plugins` property, this enhancement breaks that. However, I believe that we don't need to worry.

## Alternatives

- [#9] is the alternative. But double duplicate features cause confusion for the ecosystem. For newcomers, a mix of articles about two config systems makes hard to understand ESLint. For non-English users, the official document is far.
- [#14] is a different idea to handle local plugins. I think people have gotten used to key-value form via JavaScript object literals.
